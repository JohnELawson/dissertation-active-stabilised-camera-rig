# Dissertation active stabilised camera rig

Final project code uploaded from my final year dissertation. 

The concept of this project was to stabilise a camera. Meaning if you were walking holding the camera rig and shaking as you were walking up stairs, the rig would correct these movements and shoot a smooth video.

For this project I designed, 3d printed, wired and programmed a active camera stabilised gimbal rig.

This structure used data from gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers in three axes to calculate the position of a DSLR camera.

The motors were instructed to correct and offset the movements of the camera in their individual axes.
